  <h1>My Unofficial Local Guide to Gerritsen Beach</h1>
  
  <h3 class="beach">The Beach</h3>
  <hr>
  <p class="beach">At the end of Gerritsen Avenue, past Lois Avenue, we have a beach! It's not the biggest, but it's perfect for walks, photo ops, and swimming and regular beach activities when it's warm. If you go kayaking or rafting like my family sometimes does, you can look all the waterfront houses with docks and boats and jet-skis. (And you might see the pony in my neigbor's backyard.) </p>

  <h3 class="pizza">Victoria's Pizzeria</h3>
  <hr>
  <p class="pizza">If you want lunch, you have to go to Victoria's Pizzeria. It's a trusted Gerritsen staple; it's existed since 1962, and the pizza is super delicious. It was the place where me and all of my elementary school friends used to hang out and I always bring people there now. Victoria's recently got a renovation too! It's definitely worth a visit, and you can try their delicious garlic knots and Caesar salad alongside the pizza.</p>

  <p class="pizza"><em>P.S. I've known the cashier in the picture since we were both little kids. He's been working at Victoria's for a couple years.</em></p>

  <h3 class="park" id="park-title">The Park (& Trails)</h3>
  <hr>
  <p class="park"><strong>The park of Gerritsen Beach is another great place to hang out in nature. There is a trail next to the forested area of the neighborhood. It goes from the end of Gerritsen Avenue all the way to the elementary school, which is on Gerritsen Avenue and Channel Avenue. I love going on night walks with friends there, or just getting some excersize in. I think the pop of nature in the city is very refreshing and nice to be around and look at.</strong></p>
