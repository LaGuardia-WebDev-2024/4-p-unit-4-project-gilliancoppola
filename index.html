  <h1>My Unofficial Local Guide to Gerritsen Beach</h1>
  
  <h3>The Beach</h3>
  <hr>
  <p>At the end of Gerritsen Avenue, past Lois Avenue, we have a beach! It's not the biggest, but it's perfect for walks, pictures, and swimming and regular beach activities when it's warm. If you go kayaking or rafting like my family sometimes does, you can see all the waterfront houses with docks and boats and jet-skis. </p>

  <h3>Victoria's Pizzeria</h3>
  <hr>
  <p>If you want lunch, you have to go to Victoria's Pizzeria. It's a trusted Gerritsen staple; it's existed since 1962, and the pizza is super delicious. It was the place where me and all of my elementary school friends used to hang out and I always bring people there now. Victoria's recently got a renovation too!</p>
